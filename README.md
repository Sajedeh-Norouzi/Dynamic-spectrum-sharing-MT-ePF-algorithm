Optimizing Dynamic Spectrum Sharing with the MT-ePF Algorithm

This code is designed for implementing dynamic spectrum sharing in the context of Heterogeneous Services in Non-Standalone 5G. It leverages two optimization-based algorithms, MT and ePF. It's important to note that our simulations consider GBR (Guaranteed Bit Rate) users as a higher-priority group. This work is currently undergoing revision for publication in IEEE Access.

To utilize this code, ensure that you have Python installed. It's worth mentioning that this code is optimized for efficient execution, promising fast performance.
